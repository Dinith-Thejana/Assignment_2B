## 📍 Overview

This repository contains our implementation of the Traffic-Based Route Guidance System (TBRGS), designed for predicting traffic flow and recommending optimal routes within Boroondara using machine learning techniques.

Our system integrates:
- Traffic flow prediction using deep learning models (LSTM, GRU)
- Travel time estimation using flow-to-speed conversion
- Route finding using graph search (from Assignment 2A)
